        author={Li, Yun-Jin and Gladkova, Mariia and Xia, Yan and Cremers, Daniel},
        abstract={Understanding dynamic 3D scenes is fundamental for various applications, including extended reality (XR) and autonomous driving. Effectively integrating semantic information into 3D reconstruction enables holistic representation that opens opportunities for immersive and interactive applications. To this end, we introduce SADG, Segment Any Dynamic Gaussian Without Object Trackers, a novel approach that combines dynamic Gaussian Splatting representation and semantic information without reliance on object IDs. We propose to learn semantically-aware features by leveraging masks generated from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and utilizing our novel contrastive learning objective based on hard pixel mining. The learned Gaussian features can be effectively clustered without further post-processing. This enables fast computation for further object-level editing, such as object removal, composition, and style transfer by manipulating the Gaussians in the scene. Due to the lack of consistent evaluation protocol, we extend several dynamic novel-view datasets with segmentation benchmarks that allow testing of learned feature fields from unseen viewpoints. We evaluate SADG on proposed benchmarks and demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in segmenting objects within dynamic scenes along with its effectiveness for further downstream editing tasks.},

        title={VXP: Voxel-Cross-Pixel Large-scale Image-LiDAR Place Recognition},
        author={Li, Yun-Jin and Gladkova, Mariia and Xia, Yan and Wang, Rui and Cremers, Daniel},
        abstract={Recent works on the global place recognition treat the task as a retrieval problem, where an off-the-shelf global descriptor is commonly designed in image-based and LiDAR-based modalities. However, it is non-trivial to perform accurate image-LiDAR global place recognition since extracting consistent and robust global descriptors from different domains (2D images and 3D point clouds) is challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel Voxel-Cross-Pixel (VXP) approach, which establishes voxel and pixel correspondences in a self-supervised manner and brings them into a shared feature space. Specifically, VXP is trained in a two-stage manner that first explicitly exploits local feature correspondences and enforces similarity of global descriptors. Extensive experiments on the three benchmarks (Oxford RobotCar, ViViD++ and KITTI) demonstrate our method surpasses the state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval by a large margin. The code will be publicly available.},
