<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
Hello! It's Jim here :wave: <br />

I am a PhD student at [Learning Systems and Robotics Lab (LSY)](https://www.dynsyslab.org/) at TUM, supervised by [Prof. Dr. Angela Schoellig](https://www.dynsyslab.org/prof-angela-schoellig/). My research centers on Safe Embodied Robot Interaction on Humanoids.

<!-- <br> -->

Previously, I was a Master's student at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/). During my Master's studies, I focused on giving machine richer spatial understanding. I completed three research projects [VXP (3DV 2025)](https://yunjinli.github.io/projects-vxp/), [TRASE (3DV 2026)](https://yunjinli.github.io/project-sadg/), and [UniLoc](https://yan-xia.github.io/projects/UniLoc/) in Computer Vision Group, led by [Prof. Dr. Daniel Cremers](https://cvg.cit.tum.de/members/cremers).
